        "# Build RAG pipelines with txtai\n",
        "\n",
        "Large Language Models (LLMs) have completely dominated the AI and machine learning space in 2023. The results have been amazing and the public imagination is almost endless.\n",
        "\n",
        "While LLMs have been impressive, they are not problem free. The biggest challenge is with hallucinations. Hallucinations is the term for when a LLM generates output that is factually incorrect. The alarming part of this is that on a cursory glance, it actually sounds like good content. The default behavior of LLMs is to produce plausible answers even when no plausible answer exists. LLMs are not great at saying I don't know.\n",
        "\n",
        "Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) helps reduce the risk of hallucinations by limiting the context in which a LLM can generate answers. This is typically done with a vector search query that hydrates a prompt with a relevant context. RAG is one of the most practical and production-ready use cases for *Generative AI*. It's so popular now, that some are creating their entire companies around it.\n",
        "\n",
        "[txtai](https://github.com/neuml/txtai) has long had question-answering pipelines, which employ the same process of retrieving a relevant context. LLMs are now the preferred approach for analyzing that context and RAG pipelines are one of the main features of txtai. One of the other main features of txtai is that it's a vector database! You can build your prompts and limit your context all with one library. Hence the phrase *all-in-one embeddings database*.\n",
