        "\n",
        "- Embeddings\n",
        "  - Sparse/keyword indexes\n",
        "  - Hybrid search\n",

        "- Large Language Models (LLMs)\n",
        "  - Automatically instantiate the best available underlying model\n",
        "  - Pass through parameters enabling immediate support as features are released upstream\n",
        "\n",
        "These are just the big, high level changes. There are also many improvements and bug fixes.\n",
