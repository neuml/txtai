It is now known that poor glucose control before hospital admission can be associated with a high risk of in-hospital death. By achieving and maintaining glycemic control, primary care physicians (PCPs) play a critical role in limiting this potentially devastating outcome. Further, despite the hope that mass vaccination will help control the pandemic, genetic variants of the virus are causing surges in some countries. As such, PCPs will treat an increasing number of patients with diabetes who have symptoms of post-COVID-19 infection, or even have new-onset type 2 diabetes as a result of COVID-19 infection. However, much of the literature published focuses on the effects of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients, with few publications providing information and advice to those caring for people with diabetes in the primary care setting. This manuscript reviews the current knowledge of the risk and outcomes of individuals with diabetes who are infected with COVID-19 and provides information for PCPs on the importance of glucose control, appropriate treatment, and use of telemedicine and online prescription delivery systems to limit the potentially devastating effects of COVID-19 in people with hyperglycemia.\",\n",

Patients with diabetes are more vulnerable to the disease, and the mortality is higher than in those without diabetes. We reported a severe COVID-19 patient with diabetes and shared our experience with blood glucose management. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 64-year-old female diabetes patient was admitted to the intensive care unit due to productive coughing for 8 days without any obvious cause. The results of blood gas analysis indicated that the partial pressure of oxygen was 84 mm Hg with oxygen 8 L/min, and the oxygenation index was less than 200 mm Hg. In addition, postprandial blood glucose levels were abnormal (29.9 mmol/L). DIAGNOSES: The patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 (severe type) and type 2 diabetes. INTERVENTIONS: Comprehensive interventions including establishing a multidisciplinary team, closely monitoring her blood glucose level, an individualized diabetes diet, early activities, psychological care, etc, were performed to control blood glucose while actively treating COVID-19 infection. OUTCOMES: After the comprehensive measures, the patient's blood glucose level gradually became stable, and the patient was discharged after 20 days of hospitalization. LESSONS: This case indicated that the comprehensive measures performed by a multidisciplinary team achieved good treatment effects on a COVID-19 patient with diabetes. Targeted treatment and nursing methods should be performed based on patients\\u2019 actual situations in clinical practice.\",\n",

Integrating this\\nover habitable star formation and planet lifetime distributions predicts >99%\\nof advanced life appears after today, unless n<3 and max planet duration\\n<50Gyr. That is, we seem early. We offer this explanation: a deadline is set by\\n'loud' aliens who are born according to a hard steps power law, expand at a\\ncommon rate, change their volumes' appearances, and prevent advanced life like\\nus from appearing in their volumes. 'Quiet' aliens, in contrast, are much\\nharder to see. We fit this three-parameter model of loud aliens to data: 1)\\nbirth power from the number of hard steps seen in Earth history, 2) birth\\nconstant by assuming a inform distribution over our rank among loud alien birth\\ndates, and 3) expansion speed from our not seeing alien volumes in our sky. We\\nestimate that loud alien civilizations now control 40-50% of universe volume,\\neach will later control ~10^5 - 3x10^7 galaxies, and we could meet them in\\n~200Myr - 2Gyr. If loud aliens arise from quiet ones, a depressingly low\\ntransition chance (~10^-4) is required to expect that even one other quiet\\nalien civilization has ever been active in our galaxy. Which seems bad news for\\nSETI. But perhaps alien volume appearances are subtle, and their expansion\\nspeed lower, in which case we predict many long circular arcs to find in our\\nsky.\",\n",
