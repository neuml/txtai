It combines vector indexes (both sparse and dense), graph networks, and relational databases to offer a comprehensive solution for various tasks.\\n\\n## Semantic Search\\n\\ntxtai supports semantic search, enabling users to find relevant information based on the meaning of the text rather than just keywords. This makes it suitable for applications such as recommendation systems, content retrieval, and more.\\n\\n## LLM Orchestration\\n\\ntxtai includes support for Large Language Models (LLMs) orchestration, which allows users to integrate and manage different LLMs within their workflows. This feature is particularly useful for tasks such as prompt chaining, summarization, transcription, translation, and more.\\n\\n## Embeddings Databases\\n\\ntxtai provides a unified interface for embedding, indexing, searching, and processing text and multimedia data.

The agent also stored what it learned for future requests. This gave the agent it's own internal memory.\n",
